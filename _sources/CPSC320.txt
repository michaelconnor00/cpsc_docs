CPSC 320 Lecture and Study Notes
===============================


Oct 15, 2014 Lecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#Project discussion:

* Write a paper on a concrete language with analysis of all the aspects discussed in the course.
* Will need to do research, start with wikipedia and use the links and references.
* Language must have a free downloadable translator.
* Do not choose Java or other languages that you have been formally taught. 
* Preferably not a main stream language where there is so much material ones opinion can be distorted.
* Stay away from a language where the purpose is too narrow (ie Latex)
* Language report, not a tutorial, roughly 10 pages focusing on highlights, what is important/interesting.
* Make sure to cite quotes from other sources.

    - Prolog, 
    - Angular.js (javascript), 
    - jQuery...


#Lecture:

* Expressions: 
    - side effects in expressions are where they modify a memory location
    - order in which functions are evoked matter, z = f(x) + g(x) or z = f(x) && g(x).
    - 

C: (sidebar?) What does this loop do?

unsigned char *p, *q;
while (*p++=*q++); *p is the location that the pointer p points to.

    p = x, *p is the memory location of x
    q = y, *q is the memory location of y
    so the contents of q is stored at the location *p. Then incremented. 
    This loop essentially copies one string to another location. terminates when it hits the null char, and evaluates to false.
