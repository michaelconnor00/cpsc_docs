^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Project discussion:
-------------------

* Write a paper on a concrete language with analysis of all the aspects discussed in the course.
* Will need to do research, start with wikipedia and use the links and references.
* Language must have a free downloadable translator.
* Do not choose Java or other languages that you have been formally taught. 
* Preferably not a main stream language where there is so much material ones opinion can be distorted.
* Stay away from a language where the purpose is too narrow (ie Latex)
* Language report, not a tutorial, roughly 10 pages focusing on highlights, what is important/interesting.
* Make sure to cite quotes from other sources.

    - Prolog, 
    - Angular.js (javascript), 
    - jQuery...

Language Constructs

* **Expressions**: 
    - side effects in expressions are where they modify a memory location
    - order in which functions are evoked matter, z = f(x) + g(x) or z = f(x) && g(x).
    - 

C: (sidebar?) What does this loop do?

.. code-block:: c

    unsigned char *p, *q;
    while (*p++=*q++); //*p is the location that the pointer p points to.

    //p = x, *p is the memory location of x
    //q = y, *q is the memory location of y
    //so the contents of q is stored at the location *p. Then incremented. 
    //This loop essentially copies one string to another location. terminates when it hits the null char, and evaluates to false.

---------------------------------

* **Definitions**: 
    - int x
    - assigns meaning to a name

---------------------------------

* **Commands**:
    - Construct that modifies the state of computation
    - Could do I/O
    - Cannot under actions on commands
    - irreversible effects.

---------------------------------

* **Sequencers**:


Example:

.. code-block:: c
    x = x +1
    
- left part is an expression that points to a box where the new value will be placed. Called L-value.
- right part is also an expression (variables). Called R-value
    - however, x on the right is the value of the box 

An L-expression is a reference to a memory location

int x = 2+3;
- Definition: a storage location that is bound to the variable x (int x). not a pure definition because it effects storage (reserves space)
- Expression: 2+3 is put in the storage location(x=2+3)

Control Structure
------------------

**Sequential Composition:**

::
    x = x + 1; y = y + 1;

**Bracketing:**
    * ie - use in if condition to group the contents together.

**Selection:**
    * if/then/else

**Repetition:**
    * iteration...
    *  while loops


Sidebar:

    * ((lambda)x.Ex)a
        - where x is the 'formal parameter', 
        - and a is the 'actual parameter'
        - and Ex is the 'Abstract'

..note:: 
    * Value returning expression is a function
    * Side effect expression is a procedure...
    * Class is an abstraction of definition


f(x) = x^2 (f defines the function x^2)
f = (lambda)x.*xx (f defines the function (lambda)x.*xx)

Parameter Passing
-----------------

.. code-block::c
    
    // Pass by value
    int n = 10; // 1 binds n to a storage location with 10
    int f (int x){ // 3 binds x to a storage location, 10 copied to x
        x = x + 1; // 
        return x;
    }
    n = f(n); // 2 function is called

**Ways to Pass Parameters:**
    * The above is 'Pass by Value'
    * Another possibility for the above is to 'Pass by Reference', where x would be a pointer to n. Then the function could be a void function
    * A third option is to 'Call(Pass) by Name', used in Alog60 for example, but not used very often.
    * 'Pass by Value-Result', used in distributed computing and remote calls...
    * 'Pass by Result', random number function or input function
