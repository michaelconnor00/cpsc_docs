Ch. 1 - Introduction
====================

Intro Concepts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Important and Continuing trends in computing:
---------------------------------------------

* Ubiquity

    - Continual reduction in cost of computing makes it possible to introduce processing power into places and devices that would have once been uneconomic.
    - As processing capability spreads, sophistication (and intelligence of a sort) becomes ubiquitous.

* Interconnection

    - Computer systems no longer stand alone, but are networked into large distributed systems.
    - Since distributed and concurrent systems have become the norm, some researchers are putting forward theoretical models that portray computing as primarily a process of interaction

* Intelligence

    - The complexity of tasks that we are capable of automating and delegating to computers has grown steadily

* Delegation

      - Computers are doing more for us ... without our intervention.
      - We are giving control to computers, even in safety critical tasks.

* Human-Orientation

    - The movement away from machine-oriented views of programming toward concepts and metaphors that more closely reflect the way we ourselves understand the world

Programming Progression:
------------------------

* machine code
* assembly code
* machine-independent languages
* sub-routines
* procedures & functions
* abstract data types
* objects
* agents...

Agents: A First Definition
--------------------------

An agent is a computer system that is capable of independent (autonomous) action on behalf of its user or owner 
(figuring out what needs to be done to satisfy design objectives, rather than constantly being told).

Multiagent Systems: A First Definition
--------------------------------------

A multiagent system is one that consists of a number of agents, which interact with one-another.
In the most general case, agents will be acting on behalf of users with different goals and motivations. To 
successfully interact, they will require the ability to cooperate, coordinate, and negotiate with each other, 
much as people do.

The Micro and Macro Problems
----------------------------

* **Micro - Agent Design:** How do we build agents that are capable of independent, autonomous action in order to successfully carry out the tasks that we delegate to them?
* **Macro - Society Design:** How do we build agents that are capable of interacting (cooperating, coordinating, negotiating) with other agents in order to successfully carry out the tasks that we delegate to them, particularly when the other agents cannot be assumed to share the same interests/goals?

Why MAS?
^^^^^^^^

* Agents for software engineering  

    - The Grid
    - Ubiquitous Computing
    - The Semantic Web

* Agents for understanding human societies
* Agents for distributed economic systems


The Grid
--------
The Grid aims to develop massive-scale open distributed systems, capable of being able to effectively and automatically 
deploy and redeploy computational (and other) resources to solve large computational problems. The grid and MAS are both 
pursuing this, however from different perspectives.

Ubiquitous computing
--------------------
Populations of computing entities – hardware and software - will become an effective part of our environment, 
performing tasks that support our broad purposes without our continual direction, thus allowing us to be largely 
unaware of them.

The Semantic Web
----------------
The semantic web aims to annotate web sites with semantic markup: information in a form processable by computer, 
typically relating to the content of the web site. The idea is that this markup will enable browsers (etc) provide 
richer, more meaningful services to users.




FAQs - Objections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Isn't it just distributed systems?** -> Distributed systems don't take account of preferences.

**Isn't it just AI?** -> AI traditionally focused on agent capabilities.

**Isn't it just economics?** -> Economic solutions take no account of computation. A new type of economic system.

**Isn't it all just social sciences?** -> We focus on computational agents.



.. -----------------------------------------------------

Ch. 2 - Intelligent Agents
==========================

**Agent:** an agent is a computer system capable of autonomous action in some environment, in order to achieve its delegated goals.

Intelligent Agents:
* reactive
* pro-active
* social

**Reactivity:** environment is fixed (not like real world), maintains an ongoing interaction with the environment, and responds to changes.
**Proactiveness:** goal directed behaviour, generating and attempting to achieve goals, not soley driven by events, taking initiative, recognizing opportunities.
**Social Ability:** cannot attempt to achieve goals without taking others into account, some goals can only be achieved by interacting with others.

Social Ability Interactions:
* Cooperation: working together as a team to achieve a shared goal. Often prompted either by the fact that no one agent can achieve the goal alone, or that cooperation will obtain a better result.
* Coordination: managing the interdependencies between activities. ie - between a shared resource.
* Negotiation: the ability to reach agreements on matters of common interest. Typically involves offer and counter-offer, with compromises made by participants.

Some other properties:
* mobility
* veracity
* benevolence
* rationality
* learning/adaption



Agents and Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Objects**
* encapsulate some state
* communicates via message passing
* has methods that may operate on this state

**Agents**
* Autonomous: more so than objects. In particular, they decide when to perform an action on request from another agent.
* Smart: capable of flexible behaviour. 
* Active: not passive service providers


.. note:: Objects do it for free...

.. note:: Agents do it for money, and because they want to.


Agents and Expert Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Expert systems* typically disembodied 'expertise' about some (abstract) domain of discourse. ie - MYCIN knows about blood diseases in humans. It has a wealth of knowledge about blood diseases, in form of rules.

**Diff between Agents and Expert Systems** 
 1. Agents are situated in an environment: MYCIN is not aware of the world, only information obtained is by asking the user questions.
 2. Agents act: MYCIN does not operate on patients
 
 .. note:: Some real-time expert systems are agents

Intelligent Agents and AI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AI aims to build systems that can understand natural language, recognise and understand scenes, use common sense, think creatively, etc.
Agents aim to be simple systems that can choose the right action to preform, typically in a limited domain.

.. note:: NETBOT experience: We made our agents dumber and dumber, until finally they made money.

Properties of environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Accessible vs Inaccessible: the agent can access (it's own environment), and cannot access (physical world).
* Deterministic vs Non-Deterministic: Deterministic, any action has a single guaranteed effect. The physical world is non-deterministic.
* Episodic vs Non-Episodic: the performance of an agent is dependent on a number of discrete unlinked episodes. Easier for design because there is not need to focus on future episodes.
* Static vs Dynamic: static enviro stays unchanged (by agent), dynamic enviro is one that has other processes operating on it, hence changes (not by agent).
* Discrete vs Continuous: discrete has a fixed finite number of actions and percepts (chess). Taxi driving is an example of a continuous enviro.


Agents as Intentional Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Folk Psychology** 
These statements make use of a folk psychology, by which human behaviour is predicted and explained by attributing attitudes such as believing, wanting, hoping, fearing,...

**Daniel Dennett on Intentional Systems:**
* A first-order intentional system has beliefs and desires but no beliefs and desires *about* beliefs and desires.
* A second-order intentional system is more sophisticated; it has beliefs and desires (and no doubt other intentional states) about beliefs and desires, both those of others and its own.
